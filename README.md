# Society Hub – University Society Management System

# Overview

"Society Hub" is a web-based project developed as part of the Fundamentals of Software Project Management (FSPM) course. It addresses the challenges faced by university societies in managing memberships, events, inductions, and finances, which are often handled manually using spreadsheets or messaging apps.
